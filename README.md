# SPOT

### Hi there! I'm Sparsh Hurkat
Welcome to my garage!!

If you want to take see SPOT in actions, he is deployed on the vercel app https://sparshhurkat.vercel.app/

If you want to take a peek into SPOT's hood, here you will be able to see what he is made of...

SPOT is my virtual assistant, he is my AI chatbot customized to only answer questions related to me. He mostly has only my professional information, and restricted access to some of my personal information. The website is not only a chatbot, but also a well designed and comprehensive display of my projects, skills and experience. Everything a recruiter would want to see in a resume is here displayed here times 20.

There are 4 primary objective of this project:-

* To learn and implement NextJS & how to integrate an LLM into a website.
*  To have an interactive portfolio/resume where recruiters can read about my life, skills and projects while simultaneously displaying a few of my skills in the website itself.
* To design a cool user interface. I despised boring looking portfolios which were basically an expanded PDF. I am not a designer by profession but I wanted to see how good of a UI/UX I could pull off with this website.
* And to hopefully update this website to keep track with all the projects I do in my life.

I also started learning about Langchains through the implementation of this project, so I will implement that in not only SPOT soon but also in my future projects.
UPDATE: SPOT works with Langchain as of 2025!!! All my personal and professional information on which SPOT is fine tuned on is in a markdown file in the server_files directory

SPOT is built on NextJS with TypeScript

He is powered by the Gemini API and is absolutely free of cost FOR NOW.

I have used Cassandra with AstraDB to save some website config and to save the questions and generated responses.
