## Skills

I am a full-stack developer with a solid **three years** of experience under my belt as of 2025. I got my start in frontend web development, and quickly expanded my expertise to full-stack applications.
**Javascript** is my playground, and I'm always diving deeper into its intricacies to push the boundaries of what's possible. Crafting dynamic websites is my forte, especially with **React.js**.
**HTML/CSS**? Oh, you bet I've got those down pat. After all, what kind of web developer doesn't rock those fundamentals? But it's the art of combining these languages seamlessly that truly brings my projects to life.

On the other hand, I use **Spring Boot** to build scalable backend services, **Node.js** for server-side applications, and **SST.dev** for deploying serverless cloud-based solutions on **AWS**. Additionally, I have worked with **MySQL** and **MongoDB** for database management.
Back in my college days, I aced **Java and Python**, but my heart truly found its rhythm with JS post-graduation. While I might have drifted from Java and Python amidst the captivating world of JavaScript, my foundational skills in these languages still stand strong.
This website marks my first real world application experience with **Next.js** (let me know how i did and how i can improve). I even utilized **Langchain** to showcase my capabilities in developing a cheap and efficient **LLM wrapper**.

## Guide to Masters

This blog is a practical, step-by-step guide for anyone planning to pursue a master’s abroad. It’s based on what I learned, what worked, what I wish I had done differently, and what I saw others do right or wrong.
    I have outlined every major step I took after committing to my master’s journey — from selecting universities to acing the GRE, building my resume, and preparing for the visa interview.
    
This isn’t a one-size-fits-all roadmap, but if you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure where to start — this should help bring structure and clarity to your journey.

If you are interested in my journey to Carnegie Mellon University, you can read it [here](/guide-to-masters/#/my-story).

### Step 1: Deciding You Want to Do a Master’s
### The Most Crucial Step
This is the most crucial step in the entire journey. Once you commit to this decision, everything else — from applications to finances — will begin to fall into place.

But let me be brutally honest: You will start bleeding money after this point. So, do your research now. Talk to people who’ve already been through this journey. Be 100% sure this is what you want.

Don’t get peer-pressured into doing a master’s just because others around you are. This is not a status symbol or a checkbox — it’s a major commitment that can shape the next few years of your youth and your long-term career.

### ❓ Ask Yourself These Questions Before You Decide
- Do I genuinely want to study more?
- Am I interested in research or deeper technical knowledge?
- Can my family support this financially, or will I need a loan?
- If I take a loan, how long will it realistically take to repay?
- What happens if everything doesn’t go according to plan?

I asked myself all of these — and more — before I finally decided. This step took time, introspection, and a lot of uncomfortable honesty. But it’s better to be clear now than regret it later. I took almost a year to finalize my decision.

### 🌍 Pick Your Country & Build a University List
Once you’re sure about doing a master’s, the next step is deciding where.
- Choose 1–2 countries based on your goals (career, research, immigration, etc.)
- Finalize a list of ~10 universities to target
- Research each university in-depth: Areas of research, Admission difficulty, Application requirements, Tuition fees, Living costs, ROI (based on your goals), Application & test deadlines

### 🛠 Tools I Used for University Selection
- [US News Rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings)
- [CS Metrics](https://csmetrics.net/)
- [CS Rankings](https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us) – Based on publication output and research area
Here's the template I used to compare universities: [University selection template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2sNT01AdKO2GC46NAa2T7uA9bRvNHEETUoTOzhPVYY/edit?usp=sharing)
- Reach out to alumni on Linkedin (here’s mine: [https://linkedin.com/in/sparsh-hurkat](https://linkedin.com/in/sparsh-hurkat))

### Step 2: Taking GRE & TOEFL
### When to Take the GRE & TOEFL
Once you’ve finalized your decision to pursue a master’s and shortlisted your target universities (Step 1), it’s time to take the GRE and TOEFL (if required).

### 📈 My Scores
- GRE: 320 (Verbal: 156 | Quant: 164 | AWA: 4) — prepared and took the exam within 3 months.
- TOEFL: 113 (Reading: 29 | Listening, Speaking, Writing: 28 each) — took it 15 days after GRE with light prep.

My targets were 320+ on GRE and 100+ on TOEFL, based on the requirements and averages of the universities I had shortlisted.

### 🎯 Key Advice
- Only take these tests after completing Step 1: Many top universities don’t require the GRE anymore, especially post-COVID. Knowing your target schools lets you aim for the right score (minimum + average benchmarks are usually listed on their official websites).
- After finishing your test, you can send your GRE/TOEFL scores to 4 universities for free. Beyond that, you’ll be charged: GRE: ~$30 (₹3,000) per school, TOEFL: ~$20 (₹2,000) per school. So have your top 4 university picks ready before test day.

### ⏱ How Long to Prepare
- GRE: Needs at least 2–3 months of consistent prep
- TOEFL: Can be done in 1–2 weeks, especially if you’re already comfortable with English and just finished GRE verbal prep

### 📚 GRE Prep Resources
- My #1 Recommendation: GregMat (super affordable, in-depth video explanations, vocab lists, quizzes, mock tests, and a realistic study plan)
- Greg’s YouTube channel is also gold — especially for verbal strategies
- Other Options: Magoosh (costly, but some friends liked it)
- Classes? I don’t recommend them — self-learning is key, and this is your first big test.

### 🧪 Practice Tests Matter
- Take full-length mock tests seriously. You’ll find at least 5 free GRE tests online if you look around: ETS (official) gives 2 free tests, Princeton Review, Kaplan, and others offer free mocks occasionally.

### Step 3: Working on Your Resume
### My Background
When I decided to pursue a master’s, I was an electronics undergrad with 2 years of work experience in software development, no research papers, and a capstone project that was essentially just an internship. To be honest, my resume looked pretty blank compared to the highly competitive crowd of passionate and well-qualified software engineers applying to top graduate programs.

So I dedicated the next 4 months after my GRE/TOEFL solely to building a stronger profile — improving my skills, learning new concepts, and working on projects that would help me stand out.

### 🚫 What Didn’t Work
- I reached out to professors hoping to secure research assistant roles — even pitched them some thesis ideas. None of it worked. Most didn’t respond. Some said I lacked academic credibility. A few politely declined.

### 🧠 What I Learned
- If you're more industry-oriented like me, and not coming in with a strong academic or research background, you should consider: Professional-focused programs like MEng, MS coursework-only, or non-thesis tracks. Some universities offer industrial graduate programs, which are more suited to working professionals.
- These might not carry the same academic prestige as thesis-based MS programs, but they’re still very valid paths to grow and transition internationally.

### ⚠️ If You're an Undergrad Reading This
- Publish research papers. Don’t make the same mistake I did. I had projects worthy of publication — I just didn’t put in the extra effort to write and submit them.
- Work on projects that genuinely excite you. This not only gives you clarity on whether you enjoy research, but also gets you noticed by professors, which helps with letters of recommendation (LORs).
- Strong CGPA is crucial. Most top schools care a lot about academic consistency. Your research from Step 1 should give you an idea of the minimum and average CGPA needed.
- Graduate schools weigh research work 5x more than professional experience — especially for top-tier, research-focused programs. (this is just my informal and candid opinion, not based on any facts)

### 💼 If You’re a Working Professional
- Work on personal projects and push them to GitHub
- Contribute to open-source
- Leetcode daily, if you’re targeting CS-oriented programs
- At work, volunteer for projects aligned with the master's program you want to pursue
- Try to publish papers or file patents through your company if possible
- Look for ways to be creative and innovative, not just do the bare minimum

Even if you can’t match the academic depth of a CS undergrad from IIT, you can outshine in originality, execution, and real-world impact.

### 🌟 Don’t Ignore the “Other” Sections
- Your extracurriculars, leadership, and volunteering matter. You’re not just a GRE score or a CGPA — you’re a person. And sometimes, that human side is what sets you apart.
- Join or organize hackathons
- Volunteer in your community
- Lead teams at work, in college projects, or even in sports
- Show initiative, show curiosity, show effort
- You never know which part of your story will connect with the person or (dare I say) impress the person reviewing your application.

### Step 4: Requesting LORs (Letters of Recommendation)
### Plan Ahead
This step can take time and follow-ups, so plan ahead. I needed three LORs: Two from undergrad professors, one from my manager at work.

### 🧠 First Things First: Do Your Homework
- Your Step 1 research should already have told you: How many LORs each university requires (usually 2–3), who the ideal recommenders are (professors vs employers), specific formatting or submission guidelines (e.g., letterhead, official email, direct upload links)

### 👨‍🏫 Who to Ask?
- Ideally, reach out to people who: Know you well, have seen your academic or professional growth, can write specific, personalized letters
- If you're still in undergrad: Show up in person, visit professors during office hours, or speak to them after class.
- If you've already graduated: Email them using your alumni/student email ID, remind them who you are, what course/project/internship you did with them, and how their mentorship shaped your growth
- Some professors may not be available when you need them. Always have a backup recommender or two lined up.

### ✍️ Who Writes the Letter?
- Once someone agrees to recommend you, ask them clearly: “Would you prefer to write the letter yourself, or should I send you a draft you can edit?”
- If they want to write it themselves — great! If they ask you to draft it: List out the skills, traits, and achievements you want highlighted, customize it slightly based on what they know about you, make sure the same core strengths and messages are reinforced across your SOP and all LORs. Send this to them, and they’ll usually tweak it to sound more personal or aligned with their tone.

### 📬 How Does Submission Work?
- During your application, you’ll enter their official email ID. The university will send them a unique link to upload the LOR. They’ll submit the letter directly — you won’t have access to it.
- This can be a slow process — especially if you’re applying to 8–10 schools and the same professors need to submit to all of them.

### ✅ Pro Tips
- Give them plenty of notice
- Send gentle reminders before deadlines
- Most universities offer a grace period after the application deadline for LORs to be submitted — but confirm this with each school

### 🎯 Final Thought
- Build genuine relationships with the people you’ll ask for LORs. This isn’t a last-minute formality — strong, authentic recommendation letters can genuinely tilt the scale in your favor. Try not to use AI, it's not that hard to detect for professors.

### Step 5: Drafting Your SOP (Statement of Purpose)
This is arguably the most important part of your application.
The SOP is your opportunity to tell your story, make your case, and show admissions committees why you're a great fit.

### 💬 **My Experience**
I spent almost 2 months writing and refining my SOP.
As an Electronics undergraduate applying for a Master’s in Computer Science/Software Engineering, my SOP had to:
- Justify my academic and career choices so far
- Clearly demonstrate my transition into CS
- Highlight relevant projects, skills, and interests
- Show a strong passion for the field I wanted to pursue

### 🔍 **Do Your Research**
Some steps that helped me a lot:
- Read SOPs of alumni from your target schools. Reach out to them on LinkedIn — many are willing to share.
- Reddit is an incredibly helpful resource. You’ll find real SOPs, sample critiques, and even people willing to review yours.
- There are thousands of SOPs online if you dig a little — check blogs, GitHub profiles, personal websites, and LinkedIn posts.

### ✨ **My Personal Advice**
Write your SOP as if you’re applying for a PhD — even if you’re not. Demonstrate:
- A clear research interest
- A vision for your future
- A sense of direction and purpose
Do your homework on:
- Professors at your target universities
- Their labs and research centers
- Projects and publications they’ve worked on

**Example:**
While researching, I came across Dr. Hadi S. Esmaeilzadeh and the work being done in the ACT Lab at UCSD — I found it fascinating. So I tailored my SOP around ML systems, highlighted relevant projects and skills, and explained how my goals aligned with that lab's research. This gave my SOP a strong anchor, and a clear narrative arc.
This shouldn’t be the only thing in your SOP, but it adds depth and credibility.

### 🧱 **Structuring Your SOP**
Start noting down:
- Your journey — what inspired you to pursue this path
- Projects or experiences that made a difference
- What your short-term and long-term career goals are
- Why you’re interested in that specific program or university

You've likely read dozens of SOPs by now, but:
❗ **DO NOT COPY**
❗ **DO NOT USE AI to generate your SOP**
It’s easy to spot generic or AI-written content. Be authentic, be creative — your originality is what makes you stand out.

### 🧪 **Test and Improve**
- Get feedback from alumni, current students, or Reddit SOP review threads
- Refine it again and again
- Try reading it aloud — it helps identify awkward phrasing or unclear sections

### 📚 **Useful Resources**
- [Kartik's SOP Guide](https://kartikramesh.com/blog/kartiks-sop-guide)

### 🧠 **Final Thought**
Your SOP is your personal pitch. Don’t try to make it perfect in one go — your first draft will be bad, maybe even your fifth. But the more honest, detailed, and intentional it becomes, the better your application will be.

### Step 6: Waiting for Admits & Selecting Your Best Fit
The waiting period after submitting your applications can be nerve-wracking, but it’s also a time for reflection and research.

### 📨 The Waiting Game
- Don’t stress if you don’t hear back immediately—admissions timelines vary widely.
- Use this time wisely, you can upskill yourself a lot in this time to better prepare yourself for what's to come.

### 🏆 Choosing the Best Fit
Once the admits start rolling in, it’s time to make a decision:
- Compare your offers based on:
  - Program curriculum and flexibility
  - Research opportunities and labs
  - Location, cost of living, and lifestyle
  - Scholarships and funding
  - Alumni network and job placements
- Talk to current students and recent graduates to get real insights.
- Don’t just go by rankings—think about where you’ll thrive academically, professionally, and personally.

Remember: There’s no single “best” university—there’s the best fit for you!

### ✅ Acceptance
- Congrats if you have reached this far!!!!


### Step 7: Visa Interview – What to Expect and How to Prepare
The visa process can be intimidating, but good preparation makes it much more manageable.

### ✅ **What I Did to Prepare**
I prepared answers for any potential questions related to:
- 🎓 My program and its curriculum
- 💸 My finances and sponsorship
- 🎯 My future plans after graduation
- 🏫 The university — dean’s name, fun facts about the university and its history
- 🏙️ The city the university is in — cost of living, weather, why I chose it

I also carried an extensive folder of documents, most of which the officer didn’t ask for. But it helped me stay confident knowing I was ready for anything.

## My Masters Story


I never imagined I’d be pursuing a master’s degree, let alone at Carnegie Mellon University — one of the best in the world for computer science. But life, as it turns out, has a strange way of bringing you full circle.
If you're an aspiring engineer reading this, I hope my story helps you in some small way — whether you're at a crossroads, doubting your choices, or just looking for clarity in the noise.

## 🌱 Where It All Began
Even before college, I was certain of one thing: I wanted to become a computer engineer. I loved computers — how they worked, how software could be built from nothing but logic and creativity. So I prepared hard for entrance exams and held on to that dream.
But things didn’t pan out the way I had imagined. I was left with two choices:
- Electronics engineering at VIT Vellore, a well-known, reputed college — but in a field I wasn’t passionate about.
- Computer engineering at Manipal University, Jaipur — in a field I loved, but at a college with less reputation.

I chose VIT, hoping I could switch to computer science after the first year. That didn’t happen. Reality was tougher than I had expected, and I remained in electronics engineering.

## 🧭 Losing the Map
By the end of four years, I found myself with:
- An average CGPA
- No research papers
- No formal academic background in CS
- A major I had no intention of building a career in

So I gave up on the idea of higher studies altogether. I told myself:
“India is booming in tech. You don’t need a master’s. Just build skills and find a good job.”

And that’s what I did. I dived deep into software development, took every elective I could in computer science, worked on personal projects, learned from scratch, and committed every free hour to becoming a better engineer.

Eventually, I landed my first job as a software developer at Moneyview, a fintech startup with a highly skilled tech team. For a while, I thought I was finally past the shadow of my undergraduate decisions.

But I was wrong.

## 🌟 So, What Made Me Choose Higher Education?
Moneyview was everything I had dreamed of — exciting projects, real impact, and a team that believed in me. I loved the work. The challenges were real, the problems were interesting, and I was finally doing what I had always wanted to do.

Software development is exciting, beautiful, logical, creative, frustrating, and deeply rewarding. It gave me a sense of purpose and progress.

And yet… something felt missing.

Despite being in a job I loved, I found myself searching for more — more challenges, more knowledge, more growth. I wanted to go beyond just writing good code; I wanted to build better systems, design with intention, and understand the science behind the software.

As I looked around the global tech landscape, I couldn’t help but notice the incredible innovation happening in the U.S. — the pace, the scale, and the depth of work being done by top computer scientists and engineers was inspiring. In comparison, I felt my skillset was just scratching the surface.

After hustling for nearly two years — building products, solving real-world problems, and earning a promotion — I still felt the hunger to grow deeper.

I considered switching to a multinational company and working toward an internal transfer to the U.S. But that came with its own uncertainties, slow timelines, and lack of control over the kind of work I’d get.

Instead, I asked myself:
What if I gave myself the chance to learn again — the right way? What if I could take a break from execution and focus on understanding?

That’s when the decision became clear.

I wanted to strengthen my fundamentals in software engineering, learn advanced topics, explore new ideas shaping the future of computer science, and surround myself with people who lived and breathed tech.

Higher education — at the right place — would not just give me a degree. It would give me time, mentorship, depth, and the environment to evolve into the engineer I aspired to become.
