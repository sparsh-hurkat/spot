I've played basketball for 5 years and badminton for 6 years, some racing, some squash, some table tennis. And who doesn't play cricket and football every now and then?\nI am an avid **traveller**, I love going to new places, eating different kinds of food, going on new adventures and making unforgettable memories\nI have a very **creative** side. I have taken the elementary and intermediate art exams. Sketching and painting nature while travelling to remote corners of the world will probably be a huge part of my retired life.\nMy love for art and coding landed me in the world of frontend development, a perfect blend of the 2 worlds.`,
